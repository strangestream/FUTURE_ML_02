FUTURE_ML_02: Customer Churn Prediction System

This project is part of my work for the Future Interns Machine Learning Internship.

Project Overview

I developed a machine learning–based churn prediction system to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service. The model analyzes customer behavior and service usage patterns to estimate churn risk.

Goal

Predict customer churn and calculate churn probability to support customer retention strategies.

Technique

Classification modeling, feature engineering, and churn analysis.

Tools & Technologies

Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib, Power BI.
